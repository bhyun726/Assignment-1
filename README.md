To write a HTTP Client which can perform CRUD operations on a banking HTTP server

Please take the time to read or watch YouTube videos about how to use GitHub, and learn about "pull" requests and how to check in your code changes. We will use GitHub exclusively to stay organized with our coding. 

Learn what a "commit" is, and learn what "branches" do. This will all be available on YouTube in short videos. 

GitHub familiarity is also beneficial if we plan to get jobs as developers, so this is a good opportunity to learn.
